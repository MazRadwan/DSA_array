## QAP 1 - Movie Theater Seating Reservation System

**Located in ArrayList/MovieTheater folder**

- Implement a seat reservation system for a movie theater using Java. 
- This system will involve an array list that simulates a seating chart and various operations to manage reservations and cancellations. 
- The solution must consist of two classes: MovieTheater and Seat, and a driver program to test
with the following functionality:

**Requirements:**

1. **Seating Chart:**
   - The seating chart should be represented as a grid of seats where 0 denotes available seats and X denotes reserved seats.

2. **Reserve a Seat:**
   - The user should be able to select and reserve a seat. 
   - Upon successful reservation, the system returns a message indicating the row and seat number (e.g., "Row B, Seat 3")
   - If the selected seat is unavailable, the system should provide a list of available seats.
3. **Cancel a Reservation:**
   - The user should be able to cancel a reservation. 
4. **Class Structure:**
    -  `MovieTheater`: This class contains the theaterâ€™s name, number of rows, and the seating chart. It must include methods to print the seating chart, reserve a seat, and cancel a reservation.
    - `Seat`:  This class manages individual seat operations such as reserving and canceling a seat.
      - It also provides the seats status and number.
5. **Driver Program:**
    - The driver program  creates a MovieTheater object and test the functionality of the system.
    - The driver program  allows the user to reserve and cancel seats until the user decides to exit the program.
   
**Additional Specifications:**
- **Intialization:**: The `MovieTheater` class initializes the seating chart based on the number of rows and seats per row.
- **Display Seating Chart:**: The `MovieTheater` class  provides a method to display the seating chart.
- **Seat Class**: The `Seat` class includes methods for :
  - Reserving a seat.
  - Cancelling a reservation.
  - Retrieving the seat status.

## Recursion Assignment
- Write a function that finds the sum of a positive integer number using recursion as SHOWN in class.
- Write a function that takes in any decimal number and converts to a binary number using the flow we did in class
