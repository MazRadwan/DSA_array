## Data Structures and Algorithms
**Array assignment**

Calculate the average temperature, and give how many days are above the avarage temperature
1. Take an input from the user (eg. 5)
2. Prompt the user to enter all the 5 numbers (temperature values)
3. Calculate the avarage temperature
4. Given the avarage temperature, how many of the numbers in the line 2 are above the avarage temperature?

**Linked List Assignement** 

*Insert into a linked list*

0. if linked list doesn't exist then create it
1. Inserting at the begining
2. Inserting at the ending
3. Insert anywhere in the Linked List
